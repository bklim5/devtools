# DevTools — Project Guide

A fast, offline, keyboard-driven **desktop app** (Tauri 2 + Vite + React + TS, macOS first) for the messy bytes developers see at work. **Schema-less Protobuf decoding is the hero.** Six tools, not a catalogue.

This file is the slim entry point. The full detail lives in the docs below — read the relevant one before working a phase.

## Source-of-truth docs

| For | Read |
|---|---|
| Full product spec (decisions, milestones, UX constraints, risks) | `docs/design-and-plan.md` |
| Build+verify harness & locked decisions (authoritative where it differs from the spec) | `docs/harness-and-decisions.md` |
| Original detailed agent brief (reference; superseded by the above) | `docs/handoff-instructions.md` |
| Canonical visual system (CSS vars, typography, layout) | `design/DevTools Mockup.html` |
| Verified code to port unchanged | `scaffold/src/lib/` (decoder + 19 tests, bytes, tool types/registry) |
| Living project context | `.planning/PROJECT.md`, `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` |

## Build + verify harness (binding — never skip)

**Per task, Definition of Done in this order:**
1. **`/codex:review`** (`--wait --scope working-tree`) — address findings.
2. **Unit tests green** — `vitest` + `tsc --noEmit` clean. The decoder's **19 tests are the immovable bar**; new features add their own (TDD).
3. **Real-webview UI verification** — against `tauri dev` (the actual WKWebView), screenshot + a11y/DOM checks vs `design/`.

**Per phase boundary:** human sign-off on a fresh `tauri build` + a passing `gsd-ui-review` WCAG-AA audit.

**Plans may run in parallel, but no plan advances past these gates — no skipping ahead.** macOS only for now (Windows/Linux deferred).

## Critical constraints (full list in PROJECT.md → Constraints)

- **HashRouter only** — `BrowserRouter` forbidden (static files 404 on reload).
- **Six tools only** — nothing from the deferred list, no matter how easy.
- **Do not refactor `decoder.ts` or its 19 tests** without explicit approval.
- **No network at runtime** — self-host IBM Plex Sans + JetBrains Mono; no CDN.
- Tools import **`src/lib/platform/`**, never `@tauri-apps/*` directly.
- Registry is the single control plane (sidebar, palette, router derive from it).
- Protobuf: **cards default + rows/cards toggle**; `#N` numbers **neutral** (accent = selected only); LEN chips computed from the decoder's `LenInterpretation`; **no hover-only copy**.
- Tool components are layout-agnostic (responsive Tailwind, no fixed widths) — layout chrome lives in the shell.

## Project

**DevTools**

DevTools is a fast, offline, keyboard-driven **desktop application** (macOS first; cross-platform-capable via Tauri 2) of engineering utilities for the messy bytes developers actually see at work. **Schema-less Protobuf decoding is the hero feature**, supported by a tight set of six high-frequency transforms. It is a sharp wedge, not a catalogue — it wins on speed and confidence, not breadth.

**Core Value:** **Paste an unknown blob → get a usable, explorable interpretation in under 2 seconds, entirely offline, without touching the mouse.** If everything else fails, the Protobuf decoder doing this flawlessly is the product.

### Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Tauri 2 + Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind; `react-router` **HashRouter only** (`BrowserRouter` forbidden — static files 404 on reload). Tool logic is pure frontend TS; Rust core is thin (clipboard, hotkey, tray, single-instance, auto-update).
- **No network at runtime** — self-host fonts (IBM Plex Sans + JetBrains Mono, SIL OFL, vendored), no CDN, no accounts, no setup.
- **Six tools only** — no additions from the deferred list, no matter how easy.
- **Do not refactor `decoder.ts` or its 19 tests** without explicit approval — the test bar is the hero feature's spec.
- **Performance**: paste-to-interpretation < 2s; the app should feel instant (OS webview, small binary).
- **Verification (binding harness)**: every task's Definition of Done = **`/codex:review` → unit tests green (`vitest` + `tsc`) → real-webview UI verification**, in that order. Every phase ends with a **human sign-off** on a `tauri build` + `gsd-ui-review` audit. **Parallelize plans, but never let a plan advance past these gates — no skipping ahead.**
- **Platform (current)**: macOS only for build/verify; Windows + Linux deferred.

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd-quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd-debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd-execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.

## Developer Profile

> Profile not yet configured. Run `/gsd-profile-user` to generate your developer profile.
> This section is managed by `generate-claude-profile` -- do not edit manually.
