Last activity: 2026-06-03 -- Plan 12-02 (decimal UI mode) complete; Phase 12 signed off

**Milestone v1.3 "More Tools" roadmapped 2026-06-03.** Goal: add three new high-frequency tools (Cron, URL, Regex) + a Protobuf decimal-byte-array input mode — each clearing the product wedge with zero new runtime deps. Eight tools → eleven. The research (SUMMARY.md, HIGH confidence) established that the four features are FULLY INDEPENDENT (no inter-feature dependencies) and that every feature ships zero new runtime AND zero new devDependencies over native Web/JS APIs. Phase order is therefore purely RISK-DRIVEN — smallest/safest first, the two deep features last so verification budget concentrates on them:

- **Phase 12 — Protobuf decimal input (PRO-08/09):** smallest change; de-risks the hardest constraint ("don't touch `decoder.ts`") first and forces the auto-detection precedence decision early. A new pre-decode `decimalToBytes` in `src/lib/bytes.ts` (NOT a decoder change); widen `detectEncoding` union to add `"decimal"`; one line in `useDecode.ts`; one new segment in the encoding toggle. Auto-detect rule: comma anywhere ⇒ decimal list, all tokens 0–255, with manual override. STANDARD PATTERN — skip `/gsd-research-phase`.
- **Phase 13 — URL tool (URL-01..05):** lowest-novelty pure logic; a thin view over native `URL`/`URLSearchParams`/`encodeURI(Component)`. Establishes the bespoke "parsed-components readout + key→value table" layout and the extracted shared `Toggle` (promoted out of `FormatterView`) that Phases 14/15 reuse. Error-as-value on every `new URL`/`decodeURIComponent`. STANDARD PATTERN — skip `/gsd-research-phase`.
- **Phase 14 — Regex tester (RGX-01..07):** highest UI novelty (match-highlight overlay, capture-group breakdown, replace preview) PLUS the structural ReDoS risk. **Locked decision: matching runs in a Web Worker + timeout watchdog (NOT debounce)** so a catastrophic-backtracking pattern cannot freeze the single-threaded window. `matchAll` over `.exec()` loops; React-node highlighting (escaped text, never `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`). FLAGGED for `/gsd-research-phase` at plan time (Web-Worker-vs-debounce model, highlight-overlay technique, Vite worker bundling without a new dep).
- **Phase 15 — Cron tool (CRON-01..11):** highest logic novelty (hand-rolled next-run) + most unit-test surface. **Locked decisions: 24-hour time descriptions; next 5 runs in LOCAL time with an IANA timezone label** (mirrors the Unix Time tool); **full `L`/`nL`/`L-n` support**. Four correctness traps the iterator must handle: DOM/DOW OR-union semantics, 0/7=Sunday + 1-based months, DST-correct wall-clock field iteration (component read-back, NOT millisecond deltas), and a hard iteration cap so impossible expressions (Feb-30) terminate gracefully. **CRON-10 (`L`/`nL`) is planned as an explicitly ISOLATED final plan** with dedicated leap-year/month-length fixtures so the rest of cron ships even if it proves hard. FLAGGED for `/gsd-research-phase` at plan time (DST wall-clock read-back, the bounded field-jump algorithm, `L`/`nL` fixture design).

**Coverage:** 25/25 requirements mapped, no orphans, no duplicates. Phase 12: 2 (PRO-08/09) · Phase 13: 5 (URL-01..05) · Phase 14: 7 (RGX-01..07) · Phase 15: 11 (CRON-01..11). Traceability table filled in `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`.

**Architecture notes (from research, HIGH confidence):** all four slot into the existing registry-driven three-layer pattern — pure logic in new `src/lib/{cron,url,regex}/` (TDD); thin React tools in `src/tools/<tool>/`; each tool is one additive `index.ts` + one `TOOLS` array append (Protobuf needs NO registry change — same tool). `FormatterView` is NOT reusable here (hard-shaped to the formatting domain) — build bespoke layouts on the generic primitives (`ResizableSplit`/`StatusBar`/`CopyButton`/`useCopyFeedback`/platform seam) and extract `Toggle`/`toggleClasses` out of `FormatterView` into a shared component (recommended in Phase 13, reused by 14/15). Verify `lucide-react` glyph names (`Regex`/`Link`/`Clock`) against the installed version at build (MEDIUM confidence gap).

These ARE UI tools, so the full per-task DoD applies including the real-WKWebView gate (unlike v1.2's release scripts). Every phase boundary ends with a human sign-off on a `tauri build` + a passing `gsd-ui-review` WCAG-AA audit.

Next: `/gsd-plan-phase 12` (or any of 12–15 — they're independent and parallelizable; recommended risk order is 12 → 13 → 14 → 15).

## Active Plan

**Phase 12 — Protobuf decimal input — COMPLETE ✓.** Both plans shipped, phase boundary signed off:

- **Wave 1 — `12-01` (parse layer) ✓:** TDD'd the pure string→bytes layer — `decimalToBytes` (D-04/05/06/07), comma-first `detectEncoding` (D-01/02/03), three-way `useDecode` wiring. 3 atomic commits, 519 tests green.
- **Wave 2 — `12-02` (UI mode) ✓:** 3rd toggle segment (D-08, active-segment-is-readout, no duplicate chip), generic-`value` EXAMPLES + decimal chip `10, 3, 80, 81, 82` (D-10), placeholder/empty-state (D-09); real-WKWebView e2e + component-layer coverage. Commits `6ccbf365` (feat), `50274e4e` (e2e test), `cd16e61a` (component test, review gate). 522/522 vitest green, tsc clean.
- **Phase boundary:** `gsd-ui-review` **24/24 WCAG-AA PASS** (`12-UI-REVIEW.md`, `8554a625`) + human-approved `tauri build` walkthrough. PRO-08/PRO-09 delivered end-to-end on the real WKWebView; `decoder.ts` + its 19 tests byte-for-byte untouched (`git diff --quiet`).

Next: any of Phases 13 (URL) / 14 (Regex) / 15 (Cron) — independent, recommended risk order 13 → 14 → 15. Phases 14 + 15 should run `/gsd-research-phase` before planning.

## Recent Activity

- **2026-06-03 — Plan 12-02 (decimal UI mode) COMPLETE — Phase 12 SIGNED OFF.** Surfaced the decimal mode in the Protobuf hero UI with `decoder.ts` + its 19 tests byte-for-byte untouched (`git diff --quiet` ✓). Commits: `6ccbf365` (feat — `"decimal"` added to `OVERRIDES` plugging into the active-segment-is-readout toggle D-08; `EXAMPLES` `hex`→generic `value` + decimal chip `10, 3, 80, 81, 82` D-10; placeholder + empty-state hint mention decimal D-09), `50274e4e` (e2e — real-WKWebView decimal decode + the `1, 2, 999` named-error anchor: role=alert names 999, not base64, no crash), `cd16e61a` (component test added at the `/codex:review` gate — aria-pressed/accent-on-active + named decimal `role="alert"`). Full suite green (522 tests), tsc clean. **Phase-boundary sign-off APPROVED:** `gsd-ui-review` 24/24 WCAG-AA PASS (`12-UI-REVIEW.md`, `8554a625`) + human-approved `tauri build` walkthrough (decimal decode, clearable override, `1,2,999` non-crashing named error, example chip, space-only D-03 behavior). PRO-08/PRO-09 delivered end-to-end. **Phase 12 COMPLETE** (both plans, both gates). Next: Phase 13/14/15 (independent).
- **2026-06-03 — Plan 12-01 (decimal parse layer) COMPLETE.** TDD'd the entire string→bytes decimal path with `decoder.ts` + its 19 tests byte-for-byte untouched (`git diff --quiet` ✓). Three atomic commits: `78cbb143` (`decimalToBytes` in `src/lib/bytes.ts` — strict comma/space surface D-04/05/06, named-token errors D-07, ReDoS-safe per-token `/^\d+$/`; 12 new tests), `ee8ea11e` (comma-first `detectEncoding` branch + widened `InputEncoding` union to include `"decimal"`, D-01/02/03; classifier stays pure; 4 new tests incl. the `1, 2, 999`→decimal anchor), `2f44b130` (three-way `useDecode` switch routing decimal through `decimalToBytes`, inheriting the existing try/catch error-as-value). Full suite green (519 tests), tsc clean. Key impl decision: split-on-commas-first (segments must be non-empty per D-05) then spaces-within-segment, so `", "` is one valid separator while `,,`/trailing-comma are errors. PRO-08/PRO-09 marked Complete. Next: Wave 2 `12-02` (UI mode — toggle segment D-08, placeholder D-09, example chip D-10, e2e + phase-boundary sign-off).
- **2026-06-03 — Milestone v1.3 "More Tools" ROADMAPPED (Phases 12–15).** Adopted the HIGH-confidence risk-ordered phase shape from the research SUMMARY essentially unchanged, one phase per feature: Phase 12 Protobuf decimal input (de-risk untouched-decoder first) → Phase 13 URL (thin native-API view, extracts shared `Toggle`) → Phase 14 Regex (highest UI novelty + ReDoS → Web Worker + timeout) → Phase 15 Cron (hand-rolled DST-correct next-run; the `L`/`nL` slice isolated as its own final plan). All 25 requirements (PRO-08/09, URL-01..05, RGX-01..07, CRON-01..11) mapped 1:1 (25/25, no orphans/dupes) in `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` Traceability; ROADMAP.md appended (v1.0/v1.1/v1.2 history + the full 999.x backlog preserved; backlog 999.1 annotated PROMOTED with the delivered tools ✓-marked and the remaining wishlist still parked). Numbering continued from v1.2's Phase 11 — did NOT reset to 1. Phases 14 + 15 flagged for `/gsd-research-phase` at plan time; Phases 12 + 13 are standard patterns. Next: `/gsd-plan-phase 12`.
- **2026-06-03 — Milestone v1.2 "Release Tooling" SHIPPED & ARCHIVED.** Audit passed: 12/12 REL requirements, 3/3 phases verified, integration clean, proven live (v0.2.2 + DST-02 updater round-trip on real hardware). Archived to `.planning/milestones/v1.2-*`; tag `v1.2` (local-only). CI track parked to backlog 999.2.

## Blocker

- **None.** Milestone v1.3 roadmapped and ready to plan.

## Next Step (pick up here next session)

**Phase 12 is COMPLETE.** Pick up the next v1.3 feature — Phases 13 (URL), 14 (Regex), 15 (Cron) are independent and parallelizable; recommended risk order is 13 → 14 → 15. For Phase 13 run `/gsd-plan-phase 13` (standard pattern, research skippable). Phases 14 (Regex — Web-Worker/ReDoS) and 15 (Cron — DST wall-clock + `L`/`nL`) should each run `/gsd-research-phase` before planning. The immovable bar carries forward: `decoder.ts` + its 19 tests stay byte-for-byte untouched; offline/paste-instant/keyboard/HashRouter/WCAG-AA/zero-new-runtime-deps; the real-WKWebView UI gate applies to every v1.3 phase.

## Harness reminder (per-task DoD, in order)

simplify → /codex:review → unit (vitest + tsc + eslint green) → real-WKWebView UI verification. **For v1.3 the real-WKWebView UI gate APPLIES to every phase** — these are all UI tools (unlike v1.2's release scripts where it was N/A). Phase boundary: human sign-off on a fresh `tauri build` + a passing `gsd-ui-review` WCAG-AA audit. Binding wedge inherited by every phase: offline/no-network, paste-instant (<2s), keyboard-driven, registry-driven single control plane, HashRouter only, WCAG-AA, layout-agnostic; **zero new runtime dependencies**; **`src/lib/protobuf/decoder.ts` + its 19 tests stay byte-for-byte untouched**. Never skip gates; parallelize plans but not past the gates.
